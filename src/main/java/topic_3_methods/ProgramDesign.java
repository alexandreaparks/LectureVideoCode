        // MAJOR STEPS FOR CREATING A PROGRAM

        /*
        * Requirements - Gather & Analyze
        * Design
        * Code
        * Integration
        * Testing
        * Delivery
        * Maintenance
        * Retirement


        Waterfall method - doing all these steps in order
        Waterfall method can cause failures because requirements change constantly

        Agile development model works well for small projects and can be adapted for large projects
        Does all the same steps, but can go back to review and refine
        Build a basic, working prototype with minimal features and then review requirements and refine the prototype
        Add features, improve quality, test with respect to the requirements, have regular informal meetings
        Repeat until the project is done

        Advantages of Agile
        * response to change in requirements fast
        * issues from one stage can be addressed in other stages
        * new ideas can be added
        * there's always a working prototype
        * components are integrated earlier so integration issues can be dealt with
                * continuous integration/development - adding new code as it's written
        * programmers usually like Agile

        Building a minimal version and adding features until the project is done is usually more successful
        Agile can work very well with the right environment, project, and team
