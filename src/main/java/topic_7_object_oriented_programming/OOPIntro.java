        A java object:
        * is made from a class definition

        * It contains data (in variables aka fields)
        * AND/OR
        * It can do things (with methods)

        Example:
        A Java ArrayList object contains data - the list elements
        A Java ArrayList can also do things - add/delete an element, tell us size...

        List<String> animals = new ArrayList<String>();

        animals.add("cat");
        animals.remove(0);
        int sizeOfAnimals = animals.size();

        add(), remove(), and size() are all methods for the ArrayList object

        Java already has a class definition for the ArrayList class as well as
        many others like HashMap and FileReader

        One class definition can be used to make one or many objects
        A class definition can be seen as a blueprint or set of instructions
        The objects are built from these blueprints/instructions

        We can create our own class definitions
        Write one class definition
            *Describe what can object can do - write methods in the class
            *Describe what data the object stores - declare variables (fields) in the class
        Then use that class definition to create and use objects in your program

        Principles of OO:
        * Object modeling
        * Encapsulation - keeping data together
        * Abstraction - putting details in one place and then
          not having to worry about the detail to use the code
        * Single responsibility principle - focusing each class on one task
