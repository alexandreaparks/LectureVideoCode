        GUI - Graphical User Interface Programming (pronounced gooey)

        Event driven
        Events - User clicking a button, typing, selecting an item from a list, etc...

        Overview of process:
        *Think about GUI design - what components will it need?
        *Create GUI using GUI components - frames, buttons, lists, labels, layout managers...
        *Decide which component does what
        *Write Event Handler methods for each event

        AWT: Original Java GUI toolkit - Java 1 and up - basic components
        Swing: extended, more sophisticated version of AWT - Java 2 and up
        JavaFX: designed to replace Swing - Java 8 only - separate library
        to the standard JDK - lots of features/customization - more complex and
        never as popular as Swing because of:
        Web and Mobile - desktop apps are a smaller market
        Java web apps are huge - eBay, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Twitter, etc

        Using Swing in this class!
